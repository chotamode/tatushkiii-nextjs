    "q1": {
      "question": "Does it hurt to get a tattoo?",
      "answer": "It depends on the placement! But I work gently and always take breaks. Many clients say it was much easier than they expected. Don't worry, I also have numbing cream if needed."

    "q2": {
      "question": "How much does a tattoo cost?",
      "answer": "Prices start from 2,000 CZK and depend on the size and complexity. Message me with your idea and I'll calculate the price for free!"
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "How do I take care of it after the session?",
      "answer": "I'll give you detailed aftercare instructions and stay in touch. In short: after the session I apply a healing film for free, you'll need to remove it after 3–5 days (I'll tell you exactly when). After that, just use the cream and don't scratch it!"
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "Can I come with my own design?",
      "answer": "Of course! Bring a reference and we'll adapt it, or I can draw something similar in my style."

    "q5": {
      "question": "What if I change my mind at the last minute?",
      "answer": "No worries! We can reschedule, just please let me know at least 12 hours in advance."
